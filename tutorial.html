				<h3><strong>Profile drawing tutorial for outline analysis </strong></h3>
			</div>
			<div id="0" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					This application is broken up into a series of steps. When you participate, the platform will load a scanned drawing of an axe such as the one below.
					These illustrations are typical of how archaeologists record palstave shapes, with a plan and a profile view next to each other on the same page. Sometimes additional drawings of sections through the septum or the blade are included.
				</p>
				<p>	
					We are asking for help in digitising these drawings as 2D polygons and lines that can then be used for futher analysis.
				</p>

			<div id="1" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
				Once the scanned drawing has been loaded, you will proceed in a series of steps as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Calibrate the image's dimensions by drawing a line across the length of the axe and entering its stated length in millimetres.</li>
					<li>Draw the external shape of the axe in plan view as a polygon.</li>
					<li>If the object has a loop ignore it and estimate the outline in that area. The loop will be recorded later on.</li>
					<li>Repeat the above for the profile view of the axe.</li>
					<li>Draw a line along its flanges and stopridge.</li>
					<li>Draw the outline of the loop</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					In the first step, you will be asked to draw a simple line along the length of the axe. 
					For all other steps, you will be asked to digitise a polygon or a line by clicking along its outline. 
					To finish a polygon, double-click on the last point you wish to enter. 
					If you are drawing a polygon, the last point your enter by double-clicking will automatically be joined  back up to the first point you created. 
					In each step of the task, a digitising toolbar provides options to draw, edit or delete features. 
					Once you have completed a step, you can  click 'Next' to proceed to the next part of the task.
					On the last step, you will no longer have a 'Next' button, but instead will now see a 'Submit all' button that you can click to finish your task. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="2" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					In step 1, you will be asked to draw a straight line along the object. In most cases this will follow an already present line. If that is not the case select two furthest points on the axe.
				</p>
				<ul> 
				<li>
					Please only enter two points to create the line, not more!
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you have drawn the line, it will appear in green. Then please enter the stated length of the line in the box provided above the drawing.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>
						If there is no length on the drawing please check the index card above it. If no length is given there please record it as NA.
					</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>
						Please make sure you input this length in millimetres (so if the object is 16.5 cm long, enter 165).
					</b>
				</li>
				</ul>

			<div id="3" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					In step 2, you will be asked to draw a polygon outlining the shape of the axe in plan.

					If the object is incomplete or worn down (parts of blade/butt missing) follow the outline but don't worry about replicating the exact outline of the broken edge/worn surface.
					If the axe is looped please ignore the loop and estimate how the outline would look like without it.
					Your line will be shown in yellow once you complete the sketch and th end result should look something like the one below.

			<div id="4" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					In step 3, you will be asked to draw a polygon outlining the shape of the axe in profile. 
					Flanges (part of the axe where the handle would have been attached) are prone to damage. Because of that they might not be very regular in the drawing. Try to ignore this small scale variation and focus on the overall shape of the object.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Your finished polygon should look something like the one below.

			</div>
			
			<div id="5" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					In step 4 you will be asked to draw a line following the flanges and the stopridge of the axe. Follow the internal shape of the flanges (see picture below)

					Your line should look like the orange line below.
				</p>

			</div>

			<div id="6" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					In this step you will be asked to draw the a polygon around the loop. It is important to make sure that you draw polygons that extend into the body of the palstave. Skip this step if the object is unlooped or if the loop is damaged. 
				</p>

					In the last step, you will be asked if you wish to enter any of your own comments 
					(e.g. concerns you have about this drawing or notes about incomplete parts). Please keep these brief,
					as you can always post lengthier questions or comments on our <a href="http://community.micropasts.org" title="Community forum">community forum</a>.

					How to use the application's digitising toolbar:
				</p>
				<img src="http://micropasts-other.s3.amazonaws.com/other/amphs1tut/toolbar.png" width="50%" alt="Digitising Toolbar" />
				<p>
				<p>
					<strong>Photo loaded</strong>: This label simply indicates whether or not you are waiting for the scan to be loaded into the application.
					If it says 'Photo loaded', then you can begin digitising.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Scalebar</strong>: This label indicates what part of the axe you are currently digitising.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Draw</strong>: This option is selected by default, at the beginning of a task. Click on 'Draw' whenever you want to start drawing a line or polygon. Once you complete your drawing of a feature, the delineating line will turn from blue to a different colour.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Edit</strong>: This option is enabled once there is at least one complete feature drawn. After clicking on 'Edit', choose the line or polygon you wish to edit by clicking once anywhere on it. It will turn blue, and become available for editing such that you will be able to re-position the blue nodes that give the line its shape.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Delete</strong>: Use this option if you wish to delete your existing drawing (for the current step only).
